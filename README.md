Developing a User-Friendly Program for Gold Nanoparticle Studies

Nanomedicine is an emerging field where nano-sized carrier materials, known as nanoparticles, aid in disease prevention, treatment, and diagnosis. Before pharmacological and clinical use, the efficacy and safety of newly developed nanoparticles, must be evaluated with various studies. We have developed three user-friendly programs in Mathematica to analyze data collected from these common studies: cytotoxicity, biodistribution, and pharmacokinetic studies. The user will fill out the template Excel file with raw data and upload it to the Mathematica program. The program will perform all necessary calculations (e.g. IC50, pharmacokinetics parameters) and produce graphs (e.g. biological pathways responsible for uptake and clearance).
